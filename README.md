# Remember Me: simple game for kids to match pairs.
I have used Reactjs and TailwindCSS for designing the app. There is a timer which runs backwards. The user wins when all the matching pair cards are open within the timer limit.

## Features

- It has a simple and pleasant UI for kids where a successful tap is when two pairs match.
- Score is shown once the game ends.
- It has a timer and a confetti celebration at the end.

##Installation

- Clone the repo or download the ZIP
- Install vite through terminal
- Finally to run the app write: npm run dev
